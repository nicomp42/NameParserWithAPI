# NameParserWithAPI
Fun with parser.name and the API it supports </br>
You will need to edit the text file that contains the API key. </br>
The file is called nameParser.myAPIKey </br>
I added an enty to .gitignore to exclude files that end in .myAPIKey from the remote repo Push operation BUT the Debug folder is already excluded, so... </br>
It will be in the folder where the executable is. </br>
So, if you're running the VS project in Debug mode, then switch to Release mode, the data file needs to be moved.</br>
A good exercise would be to generalize the code to find the file in a consistent location. </br>
